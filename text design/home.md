## About the project

If you’ve been building websites during the past two years you must know that the web doesn’t live on a desktop anymore. The reality is that we now need to test our work on multiple devices instead of just few desktop browsers.

Inspired by Jeremy Keith, we decided to set up an open device lab where anyone can pop round, use the devices freely and contribute by lending their old devices to the lab. The open space for the lab is provided by Kisko Labs.

The device list isn’t that diverse yet, so we are hoping to see others to contribute too. We are especially hoping to see device manufacturers come forward and help the community.
